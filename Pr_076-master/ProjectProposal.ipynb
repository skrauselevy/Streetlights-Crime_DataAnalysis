    "San Diego is a large county and unfortunately there are many areas that are not well lit, even in nicer areas such as the UCSD campus. Lighting adds a sense of security when people are walking home alone at night. This is especially important in areas such as San Diego, where a large portion of the population must use public transportation, many often not coming home until well after dark. People we know often opt out of walking alone at night because dark areas, even in wealthy neighborhoods, are presumed to be less safe. This assumption led us to wonder how much lighting truly does affect crime rates and what can be done to lower them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The research of  Brandon P. Welsh, David C. Farrington (2008), showed two main reasons for reduced crime rates due to an increase of street lighting. The first reason is simply the idea of deterrence, well lit areas can be viewed more easily and therefore criminals are more likely to be seen and therefore are less likely to commit crimes in those areas. The second reason, which Welsh and Farrington found to be even more causal, was that adding street lights to areas signified community improvement as well as investment in a given area. A neighborhood that is improving is less likely to have crimes. The research did not show a difference in the decrease of daytime v. nighttime crimes which indicates that the lighting itself did not simply deter criminals when it was most useful, but instead overall. This suggests that adding street lights to areas may be enough to curb crimes during the day as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another study done by Steinbach, Perkins, et. al. (2015) researched how the reduction in street lighting in England and Wales would affect crime and traffic incidents. They found that dimming lights, turning some off permanently and lowering the number of hours the lights were on per day did not affect the crime rates in the areas. This seems to coincide with the research done by Brandon P. Welsh, David C. Farrington (2008), in showing that the lights themselves may make a difference in crime rates but the time of day and how long the lights are on does not. These papers along with others show a correlation between street lights and crime rates but that the lighting itself does not make the difference. This is something we plan on analyzing through our data analysis to see if there are areas in San Diego that would benefit from the introduction of more street lights and if it would lower crime rates in the given areas.\n",

    "We will remove the following columns from the  “San Diego Street Light Locations” dataset: OGC_FID, GEOMETRY, streetlights_id, polenum, sapidf, eqpid, status, x, y, and council. The resulting dataset will contain the columns: lon, lat, city, neighborhood, community. We will keep columns in the “San Diego Region Crime Incident 2007 - 2013” that overlap with the “San Diego Street Locations” dataset, such as lon, lat, city, neighborhood, and community. We will also be keeping the columns year, month, and type. All other columns will be dropped. Furthermore, we will drop rows with types of crimes that do not occur during the night time. \n",

We will create a scatterplot using the x, y coordinates to find the distribution of streetlights. We will plot the x, y coordinates of crimes on top of the streetlight location scatterplot. In addition, we will look at how crime incidents correlate with streetlight locations using Pearson correlation, and look at their plots using pandas.scatter_matrix(). This will be similar to A2. \n",

In order to support our hypothesis, we are looking for crimes committed with areas of low density of streetlights. We will report the correlation between streetlight locations and crime incidents, and also a map of the streetlight locations with locations of crime incident.\n",

    "For this project, we are testing the assumption that there exists a relationship between the amount of street lights and crime such that areas with less light are more susceptible to crime. There may be  limited contextual representation as there may be, for example, gated communities or neighborhoods with low light, but low crime rate as well that might confound our research. Also, using a large amount of information for all of San Diego, it may be quite certain that nuances in the dynamics of communities may affect our findings as some neighborhoods could counter our hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to remember that there is not much research done on occurrences of crime during the day or night on this topic, so it might be difficult to find a clear correlation between crime and lighting, and we may have to look at key times during the day when street lights would be needed. It would be also interesting to see how those dynamics change depending on the time of the year/season. During Holiday Season would, in theory, increase the level of crime. So the time of year would need to be monitored in our data analysis as well as time of day. If for some reason, more lighting in neighborhoods doesn’t correlate to less crime, as stated before, we would likely need to consider other dynamics in the system. "
